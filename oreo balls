Use the whole Oreo cookie, crisp chocolate cookie and white filling.
Place the cookies in a food processor and pulse until you have small cookie crumbs. Make sure there are no big cookie pieces.
Make sure your cream cheese is soft. If it is too cold, it won’t mix into the Oreo crumbs easily.
Use a mixer to combine the Oreo crumbs and cream cheese. I like to use my stand mixer, but a hand mixer works well too.
Roll the Oreo cream cheese mixture into small balls and place on a baking sheet or tray that has been lined with parchment paper or wax paper. Freeze the balls for 15 minutes. You MUST freeze them so you can dip them in chocolate. If you don’t, you will have a mess.
Melt the chocolate wafers in the microwave in a small microwave safe bowl. Follow the instructions on the package. You can also melt the chocolate using a double boiler on the stovetop. You can use candy coating or almond bark too. Chocolate chips don’t work as well because you want a thicker coating to cover the Oreo balls. I like to do a mix of chocolate and white chocolate. You can do just one chocolate if you wish.
Dip the balls into the melted chocolate, making sure the balls are completely covered. I like to use a fork to lift them out of the chocolate, then I shake from side to side to remove the excess chocolate.
Place the Oreo balls back on the lined baking sheet or tray. You can decorate the tops with a drizzle of extra chocolate, crushed Oreos, sprinkles, crushed peppermint, or chopped nuts. Or you can leave them plain!
When they are all dipped and decorated, place the baking sheet or tray in the refrigerator and chill for at least an hour.
